<h1>Welcome to the Belly of the Beast!</h1>
<p>You have entered (or are going to enter) the Leviathan! This is the first ever released raid for Destiny 2 and one of the most outlandish arenas in the game. The golden halls of the Leviathan hold many secrets and many games that Emperor Calus has invited you to participate in.</p><br>

	<h4>Setting the Scene</h4>
  <p>Assuming you and your team came in through the front entrance (if you don't know what I mean don't worry about it) straight ahead is a room with nine chains and a plate in the middle. 
  On either side of the Mid room there are 2 plates in the corners of the overall room, one of each pair will be in a higher postion than the other (this is important).</p>

  <div class="w3-container"><!--- The Goal --->
    <h4>The Goal</h4>
  <p>The goal of this encounter is break the 9 lanterns in Mid. In order to break them you must pull some chains to move them into view, and then stand on the center plate to gain a buff allowing you to damage them.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="w3-container"><!--- The Mechanics --->
    <h4>The Mechanics</h4>
  <p>To raise the lanterns from their hard to reach resting place you must stand on the outer 4 plates constantly. 
  You may have found the bath water on the ground isn't as soothing as you've been told, this forces you to use the main mechanic of this encounter, "Psionic Protection". 
  Psionic Protection is a Buff that protects you from the damaging water on the ground.
  In order to gain Psionic Protection you have to pick up the shiny balls that spawn on the 5 plates in the arena, the only plate that spawns balls after the encounter starts is the plate in middle. 
  Lastly, in order to start the encounter every plate has to be stepped on (I recommend a "3, 2, 1, go" type countdown). Once all the plates have been covered a bell will ring and enemies will start spawning.</p>
  </div> 
  
  <p>Now that you understand what the major mechanics are, the next step is how to use these together and achieve victory! </p>
  
  <div class="w3-container"><!--- Putting it all together --->
    <h4>Putting it all together</h4>
	  <div class="w3-container"><!--- Starting places --->
	  <h5>Starting places</h5>
		<p>Everyone should pick a plate to start at, but don't get too hung up on it because everyone will touch atleast 3 plates. 
		2 people will start at the center plate but only one will have to step on the plate to start it.</p>
      </div>
	  <div class="w3-container"><!--- Movement --->
	  <h5>Movement</h5>
		<p>Both teams will move in a triangle pattern, and both teams will follow the same steps. 
		Once the encounter starts the people starting in middle will pick up a buff then move to the top most plates of their respective sides, and replace the person on that plate. 
		The person that has just got replaced will then move to the middle plate to refresh their Psionic Protection. 
		Then they will move to the lower plate on their side replacing the person on that plate.
		The newly replaced person will then move to middle to refresh their buff, and then replace the person that took the first place (completing the triangle).
		Once you have stood on the plates for long enough another bell will ring and everyone should run to the middle plate to damage the many lanterns. 
		Once the lanterns are destroyed, congrats you have completed the Baths encounter!</p>
      </div>
	  <div class="w3-container"><!--- Shooting --->
	  <h5>Pew Pew</h5>
		<p>As everyone is moving around and standing on plates you will find various Cabal trying to ruin your relaxing vacation. 
		The trash adds you will find are Legionaries and Psions. 
		The ones you have to worry about however are Bathers, they will jump out of the triangular holes in front of the plates (they are much tankier compared to the trash mobs and are one of the most dangerous enemies in that room).
		Once you have made it to damage phase bathers will spawn in the middle room and attack you while you damage the lanterns.</p>
