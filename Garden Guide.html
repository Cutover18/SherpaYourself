    <p>Team 1 is going to be badysitting the Boss, while team 2 will be running ahead. To start the encounter team 2 (with help from team 1 if needed) will use a tether box to tether to the holographic door, this will both open the door and start the encounter. Though You can kill the floating Minotaur.</p>


		<div class="w3-container w3-teal"><!--- Team 1 cover --->   
  <h4>Team 1</h4>
    <p>You will wait in the starting room, the Boss and some adds will spawn. Kill the adds and wait for the Boss to stop shooting. Once he does, have one person follow him and be ready to pick up a White Vexxing Grenade
	(debuff) called "Voltaic Overflow" upon pick up you will not be able to pick another debuff up for 2:30 minutes (If you do, you will die), you will do this until team 2 has finished their job. After team 2 has finished 
	their job (this will be apparent as the Boss will teleport away), you will then move on to the 2nd room, then move into the 3rd room. Here, you guys will kill all the adds in this room (Important ones include: cyclopes,
	overload Minotaur, and an "angelic" hydra), after the hydra is dead the tether box in the room will be unlocked. Use this box to unlock the holo-door in this room. You will then stay in this room and repeat what you did 
	in the 1st room. Team 2 will clear room 4 and you will then end up at the final stretch.

    <p>As soon as the door is open you will move into Room 2. Kill everything in this room(Important ones include: cyclopes, overload Minotaur, and an "angelic" hydra). After the hydra is killed you will be able to use a tether 
	box to tether to the new holo-door. After tethering, the Boss will teleport out of the floor killing anyone too close. The Boss will shoot anyone in its sight for a period of time, once the Boss is ready it will stop 
	shooting and move to another part of the room. Must follow it and pick up the debuff ("Voltaic Overflow") it shoots out, this debuff will last for 2:30 minutes and during this time you will not be able to pick up another

  <p>This is the easiest part of the encounter. The goal for part is to pick up the 3 voltaic overflow the Boss spawns and to live. There will be a lot of cyclops and 3 overload Minotaurs. you can kill them if you want but I 
recommend that you just run forward to where the Boss will be. Call out who is gonna pick up which Voltaic Overflow and if no one calls out, just pick it up because the encounter is going to end after the 3 are picked up.</p>

  <h1 id="Underground guide">Underground Jumping Puzzle</h1>
  <h3>Hop, skip, and a branch away</h3>
  <p>Make your way forward past the first encounter's chest. After dropping down a glowing hole, you will find yourself in a large open area. Hug the left wall until you come across a platform that moves up and down 
  (this will be on your right). Just past the lowest point that platform reaches will be a hole that leads to a chest (this chest will only hold armor that you have already obtained and a mod specific to this raid). 
  If you look through the hole that is behind the chest, there will be a wall with many platforms. Try to jump onto one of the platforms (the bottom-most will be the easiest to land on), use the surrounding platforms 
  to get as high as you can. Then you want to jump to the closed plant right near a branch surrounded by red light, follow the branch toward the red and continue onward. You should end up at a spire with goblins around it.</p>

       <p><strong>Precurser</strong> - This one is a little more complicated to explain than the others. There are a lot of ways to do this encounter, but I'm going to talk about the one <em>I</em> found easiest to teach 
	   (its not the usual LFG strat). Feel free to look up different guides if this one isn't working for you or if someone has a different strat that they are adamant that they do.</p>
	   <br>
	   <p> Its also worth noting that there are teleporters on either side(left/right) of each side(N, E, S, W) that take you down that corridor much faster, but they are only activated when the place you want to teleport 
	   to have already been tethered to. Also this is the first encounter that you will find the "Enlightened" buff, this buff will allow you to break shields on the adds trying to sacrifies to your spire/conflux.</p>

		East to tether for the second and third time. During the 3rd tether #3 will be joining #1 & #2 for the tethers at East. After this will either be a 4th tether at East or you will enter the Hydra Rounds</p>
   	<p>#3 and #4 will move with #5 & #6 to east to kill stuff (this includes: 2 barrier hobgoblins, an Angelic hydra, and some adds. all this per hallway). Once they make it to East this whole team will tether and then move to 
	North. Once North is clear, #3 will tether with the group then stay on that side to clear adds. #3 will refer tether with #1 & #2 at East for next tether. #4-6 will move to West, clear West and tether at West. After this

        <p>Note: This a major difference in how it is often done</p>
        <p>One of the 4 sides will find that 3 Hydras have spawned and are in need of support, when this happens both of the floats will go and provide support to the side with Hydras and tether there when everything is dead. 
		During this time the Defence Team needs to find out where they are going to tether, the best place would be opposite where the Hydras have appeared. Ex. Hydras spawn at North, Floats go to North for support and 
		defence(not including the one needing support, North) goes to south to tether once adds are dead.</p>

		  Repeat will increasing Hydras until the encounter ends.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p> The 2 major ways you can screw this up is by: Dying and making a circle with the tether.</p>

  <h1 id="Windmill guide">Windmill Jumping puzzle</h3>
  <h3>There are two ways to go, the right way and the wrong way</h3>
  <p>After defeating the previous Boss, you will make your way through the spinning tunnel and find a chest this is for the previous encounter. Continuing on you will jump across a gap and find a portal 
  (don't jump in it, but you can do what you want) turn left and you will find a few platforms to move forward, jump until you round a large structure and find a giant windmill-looking thing. 
  From here you have two major paths (both lead to the same place). Firstly, you can follow the wall upward by running back and forth until you make it all the way up. Secondly, you can just ride the windmill up like a 
  BAMF (you have to stand on the <strong>edge</strong> of the holo-windmill, not the metal). At the top you will find a Vex milk waterfall, to the right of that is where you want to go. You will encounter some enemies, 
  but you are more than equipped to take these guys down. After you climbed a bit, there will be a divide in the path. Left and up leads to the chest. Right and up leads to the Boss. You will need to cross a lake of vex milk, 
  you can follow either the right or left wall (remember you can shoot flowers to open them up)</p>

  <h4>Build Team</h4>
  <p>The obejctive of Build team is to get and keep as must land as possible, because land will be taken by the Boss whenever a weak point on the Boss is broken</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Once the Fight starts, your job is to keep adds off the Banks, as they can still sacrifice and wipe your team / steal enough motes to force a wipe</li>
    <li>After the first Gambit team makes it through the portal, check what piece of land was taken. If the piece taken isn't possible to be done with only two people either leave it or ask one of Gambit people to help out.</li>
    <li>If the land is able to be reclaimed with the amount of people you have, tether from the top of the spire to the end point that corresponds with the land lost</li>
    <li>Repeat this until Both Banks are Pulsing and/or The Tether is locked, continue after Damage Phase</li>
    <li>After Damage Phase the Banks will rearange, making some pieces of land easier and harder to get</li>
    <li>The Angelic that spawns at the start will once agin spawn and will lock the Tether/Banks for as long as its alive</li>
    <li>Repeat from Step 1</li>

  <h4>Tether & Damage Phase</h4>
  <p>Once Both the Banks are pulsing the Boss will kneel and present a giant red or blue vex structure. Build team and one person from one of the Gambit teams will tether from the Bank of the structure's colour to the structure held by the Boss. Then will immediately move to the opposite bank and ther from that to the Boss.</p><br>
  <p>After successfully tethering to the Boss twice the Boss will rise into the air and open a crit spot in the middle of his stomach this is when you should unload all of your damage into him. Note: when the Boss rises the first time (just after the first tether) he will be damageable, this can be ingored for the most part but it is there if you want to do something with it
