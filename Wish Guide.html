  <div class="w3-container"><!--- Setting the Scene --->
	<h4>Setting the Scene</h4>
  <p>Upon entering the boss room (yes, we are starting with a boss) you will see: 9 plates with symobols above them, a spooky wizard with equally spooky taken effect around her, and 6 symobols (3 pairs) around the wizard.</p>
</div>
  
  <div class="w3-container"><!--- The Goal --->
    <h4>The Goal</h4>
  <p>The goal of this encounter is to "Kill" Kali. Although you can deal damage to the boss during the entire encounter, you must set up a way to avoid the wipe mechanic (unless you have a way to kill her before then). </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="w3-container"><!--- The Mechanics --->
    <h4>The Mechanics</h4>
  <p>
  There are 6 (3 pairs) symobls floating around the boss. 
  Each of the many plates around the boss are spit into 3 sections. 
  During the encounter 2 of these 3 sections will be covered in a taken effect for a few seconds, and at the end of those seconds those 2 sections wll explode and kill any Guardian standing on them.
</p>
  </div> 
  
  <p>Now that you understand what the major mechanics are, the next step is how to use these together and achieve victory! </p>
  
  <div class="w3-container"><!--- Putting it all together --->
    <h4>Putting it all together</h4>
	  <div class="w3-container"><!--- Starting places --->
	  <h5>Starting places</h5>
		<p>Everyone should pick a plate to start at, but don't get too hung up on it because everyone will touch atleast 3 plates. 
		2 people will start at the center plate, but only one will have to step on the plate to start it.</p>
      </div>
	  <div class="w3-container"><!--- Movement --->
	  <h5>Movement</h5>
		<p>Both teams will move in a triangle pattern, and both teams will follow the same steps. 
		Once the encounter starts the people starting in middle will pick up a buff then move to the top most plates of their respective sides, and replace the person on that plate. 
		The person that has just got replaced will then move to the middle plate to refresh their Psionic Protection. 
		Then they will move to the lower plate on their side replacing the person on that plate.
		The newly replaced person will then move to middle to refresh their buff, and then replace the person that took the first place (completing the triangle).
		Once you have stood on the plates for long enough another bell will ring and everyone should run to the middle plate to damage the many lanterns. 
		Once the lanterns are destroyed, congrats you have completed the Baths encounter!</p>
      </div>
	  <div class="w3-container"><!--- Shooting --->
	  <h5>Pew Pew</h5>
		<p>As everyone is moving around and standing on plates you will find various Cabal trying to ruin your relaxing vacation. 
		The trash adds you will find are Legionaries and Psions. 
		The ones you have to worry about are Bathers, they will jump out of the triangular holes in front of the plates (they are much tankier compared to the trash mobs and are one of the most dangerous enemies in that room).
		Once you have made it to damage phase bathers will spawn in the middle room and attack you while you damage the lanterns.</p>
